This file ends in ".md," which means it is a Markdown document, rather than HTML. I find Markdown easier to use than HTML, but you can easily change this to an HTML document if you prefer: just replace the .md with .html and commit! 

Here is a fun link to a [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Once you grasp the basics here, go add "Markdown" to your list of skills on your resume!
