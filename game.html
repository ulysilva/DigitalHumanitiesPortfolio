  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This project aims to show the different stages of human sleep through a game I built in Bitsy! The game shows each sleep stage, NREM stages 1, 2, 3, along with a REM sleep stage. You the player as a brain are able to navigate through rooms and finditems that are specific to those stages of sleep. You'll find symbolic items such as a Sleep Spindle or Healing drop, which show interesting facts about the physiology of sleep. The overall goal of the game is to collect all items on the way, most importantly a Morning Bell, which allows you to wake up from your sleep once returned to the start of the game! </p>
