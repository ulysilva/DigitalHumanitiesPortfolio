# Abstract

Through time, modern automotive design is increasingly influenced by nostalgia, this is 
due to consumer demand to look at the past for inspiration, in turn causing manufacturers to 
abide. Many buyers are resisting the newer car models and are instead falling back to the 
simplicity and familiarity of the older vehicles. Research shows “the value of a classic car model 
is determined by observable characteristics pertaining to aesthetics, rarity, engineering and 
performance.” (Baltas 10). With the high standards in all these areas, it is believed that newer 
cars aren’t meeting these standards set by preexisting, high performing vehicles. Though there 
are some cars which hit the bar in some areas, but lack in others. A great example of this is Tesla, 
a brand that paved way for electric vehicles, which are typically high performing but are still 
frowned upon due to the design not conforming to anything seen before. When considering the 
exact nostalgic connection made in relation to cars, it is their ability to create that emotional 
memory that involves the passage of the vehicle through generations (Setiffi). Many don’t even 
get to experience this nostalgia firsthand, this is more prevalent in a field such as the automotive 
as we are constantly straying away from the models that are often used as a baseline for new car 
designs. Though this is very present in the US, it is a common trend in locations such as Europe, 
where a large majority of higher end vehicles are manufactured. Manufacturers are constantly in 
a battle between innovation and nostalgia, this article states “Research on how to overcome this 
challenge is critical given that “the success of innovations depends ultimately on consumers 
accepting them””. (Kremer 2). With how much we use cars nowadays, it’s no surprise that people 
want to be comfortable, and enjoy what they’re riding in. “The average amount of time that 
Americans currently spend in their cars, is driver or passenger, is 18 and a half hours per week.” 
(Lutz 7). With how much time is spent behind the wheel, manufacturers push to have 
technological advancements that strive to innovate and provide more comfort, whereas many 
people like the simplistic style rather than all the techy gadgets of newer cars. Outside of visuals, 
many have also noted that there are other differences that older cars provide, where new cars fall 
short. An article states: “Taken collectively, the sensory aspects of old cars make it clear that 
classic cares are much more physiologically stimulating than new cars.” (Tam-Scott 10). The 
olfactory nerve is directly linked with your brail rather than passing through other systems, it is 
connected to crucial areas of your brain that deal with emotion and memory, it’s more than just 
the looks, but rather the smell of the engines that excites. Where companies with electric vehicles 
fall behind, along with sound. Overall, the issue of nostalgia in modern vehicle manufacturing 
should be taken into account by more than just the manufacturers, but rather the consumers also. 
Due to their direct impact, growth can be stunted by the inability to grow in mindset.
